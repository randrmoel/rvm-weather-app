# Day Planner

This project takes a day as input and uses the openweathermap api to get the current and five day forecast.  A history of the cities are kept to the right of the dash board and are clickable so you can retrieve weather from your cities.  The clicked city is also added to the history.  Additionally, UV Index is color coded relative to the danger presented.  Finally, a gif of conditions is added to each of the forecast elements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You should be running chrome version 78 or above and windows 10.
