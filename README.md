# Weather Dash Board

This project uses the openweathermap api to get the current and five day forecast.  A history of the cities are kept to the right of the dash board and are clickable so you can retrieve weather from your cities.  The clicked city is also added to the history.  Additionally, UV Index is color coded relative to the danger presented.  Finally, a gif of conditions is added to each of the forecast elements.  Finally, search history is retained in local storage and re-rendered at refresh.  However, an erase button will clear search history and return the site back to it's initial state.
